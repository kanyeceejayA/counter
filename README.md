# Foot Traffic Counter
Foot Traffic Counter for Retail Store Foot Traffic.
A Low budget Foot Traffic Counter made for Spot Chek. It is used to easily keep track of how many people are inside the store at a particular time. This helps stores avoid bypassing a limit and thus ensure proper social distancing within.

Built for use on iPads reporting to a central server, but can be used on any web-enabled device.
